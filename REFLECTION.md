# Izarra Villareal CS 81 JavaScript Module 5 Assignment 5A: Code Review

# What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?
I learned about the higher order functions of map, filter, and reduce. I learned that map can be used to return an array of equal length with different entries and filter can be used to return only what matches the filter applied as another array. Reduce can be used to summarize information from an array. These all seem very useful for working within functions using other functions to get results in the formats we sometimes require for other purposes.

# What was the most confusing part?
This module was specifically very challenging for me because I was having a hard time understanding some of the code used in the hobbyTracker.js file within the higher-order functions. I need to better familiarize myself with set as well as other methods used within the higher order functions or in conjunction with them.
